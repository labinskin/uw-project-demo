          <h1 style = "color: white;"> Purpose</h1>
            <p style = "color: white;">This project examines the Wisconsin Department of Justice's crime data from 2018-2020. Pulling in data,--including education, unemployment, poverty, GDP, alcohol consumption, and poverty--we use unsupervised machine learning to detect correlation between crime and these other variables.</p>
          <h2 style = "color: white;"> Why Crime?</h2>  
            <p style = "color: white;"> Crime is one of the most salient political issues in the United States, with a fall 2021 Gallup poll showing that 21% of Americans find it an "Extremely Serious" problem, 33% finding it a "Very Serious" problem, and 36% finding it a "Somewhat Serious" problem. Additionally, from the same poll, 74% of American believe there is more crime, than there was a year ago. However, only 14% believed crime was "Extremely Serious" or "Very Serious" in the area where they lived.

              [^]: "Crime," Gallup Historical Trends, accessed February 15, 2022, https://news.gallup.com/poll/1603/crime.aspx. </p>
              
            <p style = "color: white;"> These findings fit with an Ipsos poll from fall 2021 that found similar results, with 61% of Americans believing violent crime is up from the previous year, while only 31% believe crime is up in their community. Americans in cities/urban areas are more less likely to feel safe (65%), than their counterparts in the suburbs (75%) and rural (79%) areas.
              
              [^]: "Americans view increases in violent crime as a national issue rather than a local one," Ipsos, October 23, 2021, https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-Violent-Crime-2021.</p>
              
            <p style = "color: white;">With polling numbers like this, investigating crime data and looking for patterns and connections between that crime data and other county data could help detect trends of where crime is high and low. Finding these connections could help policy makers implement programs and policies that are more tailored to the local area and county to curb crime--for instance, if unemployment and crime are correlated, officials could work on bringing jobs to the area, boosting both the economic prospects of the area, but also curbing crime.</p>
          <h2 style = "color: white;"> Research Questions</h2>  
            <p style = "color: white;"> Some of the preliminary questions we hope to answer are:
              what are the factors that might increase or decrease the rate of crime in a county in Wisconsin? 
              Which variables cluster and correlate the most with crime?</p>
            <h2 style = "color: white;"> Our Approach</h2>  
              <p style = "color: white;"> We approached this as data scientist looking to explore the connection between crime and other demographic traits.</p>
              <p style = "color: white;">In doing this, we gathered data from a variety of different sources. This process and our sources are explored in the data section.</p>
              <p style = "color: white;"> We used Machine Learning to analyze the data, looking for clusters and connections between them. And in-depth discussion of this is process is in our Machine Learning section.</p>
              <p style = "color: white;"> To help us understand the data, we used Tableau to visualize the connections, clusters, and correlations between our different variables. Interactive elements are in our Data Visualization section.</p>
              <p style = "color: white;"> To conclude, we have a few key takeways from our data analysis, as well as a discussion of possible paths forward.</p>

    <p style = "color: white;">A relational database is a collection of data organized as tables that can relate to one another through primary and foreign keys. The acronym CRUD represents four key operations used on the data needing to be tracked. By following this method, we were able to produce a clean database.</p>
    <p style = "color: white;" >  To start building our database, nine tables, showing in our ERD, were made and loaded with data we had gathered from multiple sources. We then used SQL inner joins to merge eight of these tables on county, creating two tables for our machine learning model to reference. Our offenses data required a bit more work. Once the three datasets were loaded into an offenses table, we wanted to group columns in order to see only pertinent information. The following code was used to do so:

          <h2 style = "color: white;"> Why machine learning</h2>
            <p style = "color: white;">The goal of this project is to answer a question; what drives crime in Wisconsin? Most residents will have an opinion on what is contributing to crime and they may even have an opinion of what should be done to limit crime. These opinions are as varied as the person stating them, and unless coming from an expert in the field, there is little confidence that these opinions are correct. A better way to make a large scale, and more confident assessment, is to use data driven decision making. Using a large, publicly available, dataset is the start of this process. An efficient next step is to utilize an automated analytical method to identify patterns and learn from the data. Patterns in the data have the potential to predict or at least highlight possible routes of crime intervention. An efficient tool to recognize these patterns or predictions is machine learning. </p>
          <h2 style = "color: white;"> Clustering</h2>  
            <p style = "color: white;"> There are a couple of ways to approach this problem, and one of them is to recognize groupings or patterns within the data. Unsupervised machine learning for clustering data is a solution to recognize groups within the large dataset. The clustered data will hopefully make potential relationships easier to identify. The quality of these results will be dependent upon distribution of the data. A tight cluster, or shaped cluster, will likely represent a strong relationship between features, and an odd shape or dispersed cluster will represent a weak relationship.</p>
          <h2 style = "color: white;"> Model Choice</h2>    
            <p style = "color: white;"> Choice of model for clustering in this analysis is heavily influenced by the two resources below. K-Means, provided by scikit-learn, is the method of choice to start. The K-Means method is a general-purpose algorithm that does not use many clusters, and calculates clusters based on distance between points. The K-Means model is a good choice to start but can be limited depending on the data. An elbow curve is used to determine the number of clusters to be input to the K-Means method. Depending on the scaler used, the elbow curve suggests the number of clusters are six to eight. Clusters are output from the model and there are some relationships to pursue.

              Using the variable correlations from the exploratory analysis drove many of the decisions on what axis to use. By using variable pairs that had strong correlation values, dense clusters were output. A couple of some of the most distinct and dense clusters were when different crimes were plotted together or when crimes are plotted with poverty. The dense clusters that were output signify a strong relationship.  
              
              K-Means does have a good output, but it there is certainly room for improvement. Some of the groupings are dense but are uneven in size. There are also outliers in the data that can cause issues for the K-Means model. A second method has been attempted to produce a model. DBSCAN is the second method selected because it often performs better with uneven clusters, and removes outliers within the dataset. Unfortunately, at this point in the analysis the DBSCAN model output is a single cluster. Inputs are being manipulated but no change has produced a better output to date. If time permits, another method will be attmepted. </p>

        <p style = "color: white;">Poverty rates were one of the biggest indicators of crime. To take one of the twelve different crime variables, Total Offenses, outside of other crime, the different poverty variables (upper/lower bound of all ages, upper estimates for children 5-17 or people 0-17) all had correlations above .97. </p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="column left" style="background-color: rgb(3, 3, 51);">
        <p style = "color: white;">There were two consistent sets of variables that appeared: alcohol use and the urban/rural code. There were a few different alcohol variables and they appeared further away in clustering and were typically negatively correlated or very weakly positively correlated, indicating not much strength. These factors indicate that alcohol does not predict correlate to crime in Wisconsin counties. However, there is a minor caveat. There was not a single WI county where the basic alcohol consumption level for both sexes was below 50%, meaning in every county at least 50% of the population consumes alcohol. A very high level of drinking overall. Such high level could cloud the clusters and correlation.</p>

        <p style = "color: white;">The other interesting negative correlation variable that appeared for all the crime type variables is the urban/rural code. This indicates that where you live, urban or rural, does not indicate the level of crime in your county. More urban counties are not necessarily higher in crime than more rural counties. </p>

        <h1 style = "color: white;"> Paths Forward</h1>  
          <p style = "color: white;">There are a variety of different paths forward.</p> 
          <p style = "color: white;">First, we could find more variables, and possibly updated alcohol data, to test against the crime data, as the alcohol data was from 2002 to 2012 and our crime data was from 2018-2020.</p> 
          <p style = "color: white;">Additionally, with the alcohol data we could see if the WI DOJ has data going back to the time of the alcohol study (2002-2012). Adding more crime data from a couple of decades ago, along with more years of the other variables could provide depth and more insight into the variable’s correlation. </p>  
          <p style = "color: white;">A few possible variables to find would be religiosity and/or religious affiliation, type of occupation--expanding past employed/unemployed and examining the different types of jobs, and political affiliation or non-affiliation, to name but a few possible expanded variables. </p>
          <p style = "color: white;">Second, we could look for clustering and possible correlation among other variables for an expanded scope, not just focusing on crime, but other variables. </p>
          <p style = "color: white;">Third, many of the datasets we used for the other variables included all counties across the United States. Using that data and finding crime data for those states and counties, we could begin to compare states and counties across the country. This would provide more insight into crime across the country. This study would be a large undertaking, but the benefits of understanding the variables that may influence crime would be incredibly useful for policymakers at all levels. </p>
          <p style = "color: white;">Fourth, with the negative correlation of crime and urban/rural codes, it would be interesting to go deeper and see if this is true across the United States. Furthermore, it would be interesting to study if one particular type of crime was prevalent in rural or urban counties.</p>
