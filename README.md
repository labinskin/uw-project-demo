### Presentation
##### Content

The topic we selected was crime, specifically crime by county in the state of Wisconsin. This topic was selected for a few different reasons. First, the boot camp is housed and hosted by the University of Wisconsin system, with a majority of the students being based in the state. Examining crime, a usually pertinent issue to many, for the majority of the class would be of interest to them. Second, the state of Wisconsin's Department of Justice has a five year record of crime statistics by county, providing a well kept or organized set of data for us to work with--even if we are just going to use the last three years. Third, delving deeper into what might be the reason crime or certain crimes are higher or lower in certain counties will provide insight into the issue overall.

The data sources that we will use include the Department of Justice from the state of Wisconsin. We are using stats from 2020, 2019, and 2018. Even with the data going back another couple of years, the GDP data only goes back three years, so to keep data for all the years, we are sticking to these three years (providing over 10,000 rows of data themselves). We are also pulling county by county GDP data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis to explore if crime is connected to economic output. We are pulling educational and poverty data from the USDA's Economic Research Service, which is covered by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). You can find the links to these data, as well as some of the flat CSV files (data folder above).

As for the preliminary questions we hope to answer is what are the factors that might increase or decrease the rate of crime in a county in Wisconsin? Does educational attainment influence this rate? Does poverty level factor into the level of crime? Does economic output (GDP) factor into the rate of crime? These are the preliminary questions, but these could be expanded if we find other datasets that could be included, for instance demographic information (like married or single, religious or non) or different avenues could be explored based on what we find in the data itself.
